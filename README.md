## üìå Introduction

Negative sampling plays a critical role in training graph-based collaborative filtering (GCF) models.  
Traditional negative sampling strategies often ignore **global** and **local** contextual information, leading to suboptimal performance.  

In this work, we propose **Dual Context-Aware Negative Sampling (DCANS)**, which integrates:
- **Global context**: semantic similarities across the entire user‚Äìitem graph.
- **Local context**: neighborhood-aware sampling to capture fine-grained relationships.

Our method improves both **alignment** and **uniformity** in the learned embeddings, leading to more robust recommendations.

## üöÄ Features
- **Dual Context-Aware Sampling**: Combines global and local graph contexts for negative sample selection.
- **Plug-and-Play**: Can be easily integrated into existing GCF models such as LightGCN, NGCF, etc.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieves significant improvement on multiple benchmark datasets.
